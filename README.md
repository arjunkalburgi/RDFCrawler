## RDF Crawler

This project was made for Dr. Reformat and the Dean's Research Award at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Engineering. 

# Analysis of Resource Description Framework (RDF) 

The RDF is a common tool used for describing resources online. Metadata like RDF is what powers the technology industry and drives us to innovate. As with any data, it is important to be able to load, query, store, and finally write RDF triples in other to understand something with that data. 

The goal of this project was to build a program that does exactly this: load, query, store and write RDF triples. The program would empower the user to search through links of triples (crawling) resulting in a graph of RDF Data. This was done by creating a RDF crawler. 

The project as it stands now does not have complete write capabilities. These bugs are yet to be worked out. 

In future studies, it may by of interest to compare different graphs of RDF data. To see how similar graphs are.
